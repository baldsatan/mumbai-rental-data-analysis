# mumbai-rental-data-analysis
This project seeks to analyse the rental realty market in Mumbai, one of the most expensive markets of South Asia.
The data has been scraped from 99acres.com on July 16,2018 using data-miner.io.
The dump file has been cleaned on Excel for generating/isolating features for each rental listing.
RStudio & ggmap library were used to get geodata for the locations from the Google API.
The ultimate objective of this project is to create a geographical heatmap of rental values.
In hindsight, I believe we can also use this dataset to predict rental prices in Mumbai
